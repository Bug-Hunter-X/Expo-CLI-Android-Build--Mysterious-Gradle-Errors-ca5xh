# Expo CLI Android Build: Mysterious Gradle Errors

This repository demonstrates a difficult-to-diagnose issue with the Expo CLI Android build process.  The error is characterized by unclear or misleading error messages from the Gradle build system, making it challenging to pinpoint the root cause.

The `unclearGradleError.js` file contains a sample Expo project exhibiting the problem. The `gradleErrorSolution.js` file provides a potential solution, but the specific fix will depend on the exact error messages encountered.

**Problem:**
During the `expo prebuild` or `expo build:android` stages, the build process fails with confusing Gradle error messages, often lacking specific details about the cause.

**Possible Causes:**
* Conflicting dependency versions
* Incorrect Android configuration in `android/build.gradle` or `android/settings.gradle`
* Problems with the Android SDK or build tools
* Inconsistent or missing dependencies

**Potential Solution (See gradleErrorSolution.js):**
This example involves carefully reviewing dependency versions and ensuring they are compatible.  In other cases, inspecting the `android` folder for issues might be necessary.  Refer to the solution file for more information.
