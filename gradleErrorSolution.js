The solution often requires a careful examination of the `android/` directory within your Expo project.  Check the `build.gradle` and `settings.gradle` files to ensure they are properly configured for your project's dependencies and settings.  Look for any conflicting dependencies or version mismatches.  A common strategy is to try cleaning the build cache using `./gradlew clean` inside the `android/` directory and then rebuilding.  If dealing with specific missing dependencies, add them to the `build.gradle` file.  Ensure you're using a supported version of the Android SDK and build tools.  The precise solution varies greatly depending on the error, so carefully reviewing the error logs is crucial.
