This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves issues with the Android build system, specifically the `gradle` build system.  The error message might not be entirely clear, often pointing to seemingly unrelated issues like missing dependencies or incorrect configurations.  It often manifests as a failure during the `expo prebuild` or `expo build:android` steps.  The root cause might be related to conflicting versions of dependencies, incorrect configurations within the `android/` directory (e.g., `build.gradle`, `settings.gradle`), or underlying issues with the Android SDK or build tools.
